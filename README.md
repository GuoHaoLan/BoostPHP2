# BoostPHP2
An fast, simple, require-and-go out-of-box PHP framework built for PHP7.1+

## How to use it
Put the files in BoostPHP directory and simply add following code to your PHP file.

```
require_once __DIR__ . "/BoostPHP/GeneralUtility.php";
require_once __DIR__ . "/BoostPHP/Cache.php";
require_once __DIR__ . "/BoostPHP/Encryption.AES.php";
```

Not every files need to be required, you can require them based on your needs.
Manuals will come later.
